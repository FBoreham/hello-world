# hello-world
Created as part of the Hello World tutorial on GitHub for learning how to create repositories etc.

A bit about me:
I am a Geology PhD student who is learning to code in order to do some modelling. There are daffodils on my desk at the moment and they make me smile; they're such unashamedly gaudy and optimistic flowers.
